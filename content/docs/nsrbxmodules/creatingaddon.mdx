<Callout title="Notice on Behavior" type="warning">
  During play-testing, no real data will be shared or written — but permission checks, config parsing, and debug messages *will still work*.<br/>
  <small>( So you don't need any of our code! )</small> <br/>
  Watch the Output window for debug info!

<Steps>
    <Step>
     ### Navigate to:
   
        <Files>
            <Folder name="ServerScriptService" defaultOpen>
                <Folder name="community_addons" defaultOpen>
                </Folder>
            </Folder>
        </Files>
    </Step>

    Then create a new Script and name it however you like.
   
   <Step>
   ### Paste this example code to get started:
   
    ```lua twoslash lineNumbers title="My Addon"
    local addon_manager = require(game.ServerStorage.com_lib:WaitForChild("AddonManager"))

    local addon_config = {
        name = "My First Addon",
        ver = 1.0,
        description = "This is my first addon!",
        permissions_requests = {
            "player_info",
            "data_store",
        },
        category = "Fun"
    }

    local function startup()
        addon_manager:print("Addon loaded successfully!")
    end

    addon_manager:CreateAddon(addon_config, startup)
    ```
    </Step>

    <Step>
        <Callout title="You can add folders, modules, models, etc. inside your addon script.  " type="success">
             They’ll load normally!
        </Callout>
    </Step>

## Addon Config Reference

```lua twoslash lineNumbers title="Addon Config"
{
  name = "Your Addon Name",        -- (Required)
  ver = 1.0,                       -- (Required) Version number for compatibility checks
  description = "Short description of your addon",
  category = "Items",             -- (Required) Can be: Fun, Mechanic, Items, etc.
  permissions_requests = {        -- (Optional) Request only what you need
    "player_info",
  }
}
```

## Permission System

Each addon must request permissions to access features like player data or datastore.

| Permission       | Description                                                                                       |
|----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| player_info        | Allows editing player data (without this, access is read-only).                                   |
| data_store         | Enables saving and loading persistent data via addon_manager:DataStore(...).                        |
| teleport           | Grants access to teleport players using the managed teleport API.                                     |
| skip_virtualenv    | Disables the requirement to use managed/sandboxed functions (e.g., direct execution access).   |
| workspace_access   | Grants permission to create or modify objects in workspace. Without it, access is read-only.        |
| lighting_edit      | Allows changes to Lighting service (e.g., time of day, fog, ambient).                               |
| chat_send          | Enables sending messages to chat on behalf of the addon.                                              |
| admin_only         | Restricts execution to players with admin/dev permissions.                                            |
| http_requests      | Allows limited usage of HttpService if enabled globally (use with caution!).                        |
| camera_control     | Grants permission to manipulate player cameras (e.g., cutscenes, zoom effects).                       |
| ui_edit            | Allows creation/modification of player GUIs using managed UI functions.                               |

### Tips for Beginners

- Only request permissions you actually use.
- Group your logic in modules for easy readability.
- Watch the Output tab when testing – lots of debug info is printed.
- Avoid using global variables or modifying core game stuff unless needed.
